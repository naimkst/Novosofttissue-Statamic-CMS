  he Macarena by Los Del Rio (Remixed by the Bayside Boys) has been #1 on the charts for 14 weeks in a row.
  
  It's an international hit and dance craze. Rumor has it that the band spotted a beautiful flamenco dancer named Diana Patricia Cubillan Herrera at a private party held by the Venezuelan empresario in Venezuela. Her beauty and grace inspired them to write the song, and the rest is history.
  
  But do you know where the dance featured in their music video (released earlier this year) came from? No, of course you don't.
  
  ## It happened in Rio
  
  Last spring I was vacationing in Rio with my family. We had been there a few weeks, staying in a friend of the family's villa in the quiet area of Lagoa.

  As if bolt of lightning struck us all at once, we sprinted â€” nay, hurled our bodies towards the pedestal without regard for life or limb. The collision of human bodies could be heard 6 blocks away as fists swung and hands clawed, hair tore away in chunks, buttons flew from plaid hoodies tied around waists, and sneakers took to the air, loose of their foots.
  
  I can't say how, or at what cost, but my hand closed around the ice cold can first. It was mine. The crowd fell back, subservient to the victor like the days of Sparticus, Crixus, and Marcus Attilius. I cracked the tab and a cool spray of citrus coated those lucky enough to be close. I tossed my head back and from the height of my upwards and outstretched arm, poured the sweet nectar of the gods down my throat.
