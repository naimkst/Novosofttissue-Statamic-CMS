    question: 'What is the cost?'
    answer: |
      Our new patient comprehensive exam is $240. The comprehensive exam includes patient history, physical examination, review of medical records, diagnosis, and explanation of your diagnosis to you. No treatment is performed on the first visit.
      
      Follow-up visits are $80 and last 10-15 minutes. Typically patients experience a 50% improvement within the first six visits, at which point we will re-evaluate to determine future treatment frequency.

    question: 'Do you accept insurance?'
    answer: 'We do not accept insurance. Insurance companies are mostly concerned with their bottom line, and we are entirely concerned with establishing an accurate diagnosis and delivering effective treatment. We will provide medical billing to you that you may send to insurance for reimbursement, and they may reimburse all or a portion of costs directly to you.'
