    testimonial_copy: 'I felt welcome from the moment I set foot in the door! This was my first experience using the service of a chiropractor, and I was impressed with the progress we made in the short amount of time that I was with Dr. King. I visited to get help with my SUPER tight hamstrings and legs while training for a race. My range of motion was increased, recovery time decreased and I was able to feel great while running lots of miles!'

    testimonial_copy: 'I was told by several surgeons a neck fusion was my only option. My husband found Dr. King on-line and said it’s worth a try before surgery... I’ve now been going for almost a year and I feel completely healed. I have recommended him to everyone I know and we are all believers that a 10 min appointment can truly heal you!'

    testimonial_copy: 'HIGHLY recommend. When I find a place I trust, I can''t recommend them enough. I am a fitness professional and it takes a toll on my body. I was getting weekly massages and tried a variety of things to relieve my pain.  Unfortunately, these were just bandages. Dr. King took the time to listen as I described all my aches and pains and after the very first appointment I finally felt real relief!  I almost couldn''t believe it!  I really appreciate that he takes the time to explain what he is doing. Not only was I able to feel the difference immediately, he was able to show me actual numbers that correlate to my range of motion. It helps me understand how my body should be working.  The team is also wonderful.  When I needed insurance documents they provided them in less than 24 hours.  Friendly and professional - definitely recommend. Thank you Novo!'

    testimonial_copy: 'I''m one of those hopeless cases that was told I might have to live with pain the rest of my life. It''s been many years in the making and I wasn''t willing to accept it. My research brought me to Novo and Dr. King and he has helped me greatly not only to understand what was happening in my body to begin working on it. We''re not done yet as I have many areas of injury but I have seen great improvement in my strength and endurance since beginning. Dr. King is not cheap, but his attention and expertise is worth it.'

    testimonial_name: 'Marisa N.'
    testimonial_copy: 'I had hip surgery almost 6 years ago and have had new and debilitating pain ever since that made walking very unpleasant and difficult. I have sought help from many, many physical therapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and orthopedists. I would usually achieve a 50% improvement, but then I was dismissed because they didn''t know what else to do for me. Dr. King was literally my last hope. I had a suspicion that adhesions were part of my problem because of my seeming talent at making them in response to injury in other parts of my body. What''s great about Dr. King is that 1. he knew what to do and 2. he was willing to keep at it, no matter how long it took. It took about 8 months, but one day I realized that my pain level was consistently about a 1-2 (instead of 7-8), and sometimes gone entirely. I still see Dr. King every few weeks for a tune up---between some back degeneration, the length of time I had the adhesions and my proclivity for making them, I imagine that may be true for awhile. My time with Dr. King has been worth every penny and I am so grateful to be able function again!'

    testimonial_copy: 'I''ve been seeing Dr. King for over a year now and he has literally fixed 3 issues I have been having for numerous years. Neck pain is gone, back pain is gone, ankle pain is gone. My mobility on all 3 of these issues is up big too. I will continue to see him regularly to catch issues before they get worse. I can''t thank him and his wonderful team enough. Everyone is super friendly and they run a tight ship, which is much appreciated. I think the longest I have waited was 3 or 4 minutes, which is nothing in the doctor world.'

    testimonial_copy: 'I discovered Novo Soft Tissue not long ago for a lingering back and neck problem. I’ve been to other doctors, physical therapists, massage therapist etc with no remedy, but Dr. King and his team were able to identify and execute a treatment plan that worked!  Dr King is a very skilled professional, and his adhesion release technique is a rare talent and he truly sets himself apart from anyone else. I highly recommend their services if you have nagging issues no one else can seem to fix. Get well!'

    testimonial_name: 'Nikolas T.'
    testimonial_copy: 'I cannot recommend Novo Soft Tissue enough. I am 26 years old and have had back pain since I was 15 years old. My pain was a result of over use and repetitive movements through sports. Once the pain became too much to compete further I replaced my desire for competition through video games. Poor posture and being sedentary for long periods of time only created more pain and lack of mobility. It did not matter how much yoga or strengthening I did to counter my poor posture or fix my injuries. It had got to the point where I felt stuck and unable to engage certain muscles. I felt like I was too young to feel this way. I had been to many different chiropractors and would not get sustainable relief. Through addressing postural problems and targeting specific areas to strengthen I now have a solid foundation to live pain free for the rest of my life, enjoy video games and be physically active!'

    testimonial_name: 'Danielle D'
    testimonial_copy: 'I started seeing Dr. King a couple of years ago for pain in my neck, back, and foot.  I was in a bad crash when I was younger, and had been dealing with ongoing pain ever since.  My job forces me to sit for long hours, which isn’t helpful for chronic pain.  I have seen dozens of medical doctors, physical therapists, and chiropractors over the years, very few of which have been able decrease my pain levels in any way.  Medicine works temporarily, but it is not a long term solution for me and I really needed something that would actually help my pain instead of only masking it.  Dr. King has done a great job of decreasing my pain levels and was the first doctor to give me a solution that wasn’t completely temporary.  My husband can tell when I’m going to regular appointments with Dr. King because I’m in noticeably less pain on a daily basis.  It can be difficult to make time to take care of myself with a busy work schedule, but it is 100% worth it.  Also, his staff is friendly, which I always appreciate.'

    testimonial_copy: 'Dr King saved me from Surgery. I went a year ago with pinched nerves from compressed discs in my neck.  I couldn’t move and had migraines that were relentless. After the first week the migraine went away and I had some movement back.  After 2 months with 2X a week, I had full range of motion. I now go back for maintenance. But If I do something wacky and feel like there is damage, I call and get an appointment that day or the next.  Dr King and his powerful thumbs are life savers. His office staff are super nice too.'

I’ve been seeing Dr.King for 10 months and see him every 2 months with my neck and shoulder pain being minimal. Dr King teaches how to treat your issue and his goal is to treat and have you never come back! He truly cares about his patients and well being.'

      I’m 42 years old and I’ve had back and neck problems since high school. I was always hurting and popping Advil to get through the pain. I’ve seen chiropractors for decades and would feel better immediately after the appointment but would then start hurting again. I got to a point where my arms and fingers started going numb. 
      
      I found Dr. King through an ad on Facebook and thought, “Why not try this? My chiropractor regimen clearly wasn’t working.” 
      
      Dr. King’s intake appointment/evaluation was fast but he seemed to know what was keeping me in pain. After my first appointment, I felt so much better! The tension and pain were gone. Within two weeks, my numbness had disappeared, headaches stopped and I wasn’t in pain for the first time that I could remember. 
      
      My daughter sees Dr. King now and we both are so happy we found Novo Tissue and Spine. I can’t recommend Dr. King and his office highly enough.

When we sat down to discussion my issues, he listen, explained and discussed a plan that would get me on the road to feeling better.  When you live with pain, you think that it is your normal.  I had years of repetitive use, but after three months I am able to live without pain.  I would recommend the team at Novo Soft Tissue.  Before you consider surgery, I would reach out to Dr. King.  Many thanks!'

After a little over a month of treatments I feel better than I have in months. I''m back at work and I have so much more Mobility than I did before. It felt like a miracle. If you''re even thinking about going to Novo stop thinking and just do it your health is worth it.'

      I can't say enough about Dr. King and his staff.  I had severe sciatica pain flare up after a 12 year hiatus.  I was miserable and had tried traditional chiropractic, acupuncture, electropuncture, cupping, inversion, etc.  Nothing worked beyond very mild, temporary relief.
      
      After several months, I finally made an appointment at Novo Soft Tissue.  Dr. King was very thorough in his diagnosis and in explaining what was causing my pain.  He explained the treatment plan and managed my expectations of the treatment.  It took several visits (a week and a half or so in total) to have significant relief, and I am now pain free.  I couldn't be happier with my experience at Novo Soft Tissue.
      
      Thank you, Dr. King.  You made a big difference in my quality of life!

It got bad enough that I stopped running completely, and it was even hurting to walk. I tried everything else, physical therapy, kt tape, cbd, different shoes, special insoles. Finally, a friend referred me to Scott and after only two months, my pain is gone and it looks like I might even be able to run again some day soonish. Really, truly grateful and amazed.'

      I’ve had severe back pain for twenty years, from my tailbone to the base of my skull. After six different chiropractors, four specialists, three procedures, and many different kinds of physical therapy, I’d pretty much given up on ever feeling better. 
      Dr. King and his treatments are the only thing that has been successful in actually fixing the problems and drastically lowering my pain levels in a relatively short amount of time. Calling him a life saver is not hyperbole. If you have physical pain and feel you have tried everything else, call Dr. King.
